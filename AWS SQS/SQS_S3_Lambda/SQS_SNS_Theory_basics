    Message Processing Workflow :
--> 1. A Message is published to the queue.
    2. Message is claimed by the receiver and visibility timeout countdown starts
        -Visibility countdown, is a time threshold when a Message is claimed by a receiver/thread at that time it
          allows the thread/ receiver to process it in a particular time, if it doesn't amke the process succeffully
          complete with in the time then the message will be unlocked and again it will appear in the Queue.
    3. a. Message is processed and Deleted by thr consumer
       b else. Visibility timeout expires and message returned to queue.

    Types of Queue :
 --> Standard queue : Order is not guaranteed  (Less Expensive)
     FIFO queue : Order is there, so that message will process in a order.(Expensive as compare to Standard one more than 25%)
